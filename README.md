# refactor
Refactor HW Assignment

For this assingment I did the following

Changed some <divs> to symantic tags (header, section, aside, footer) to avoid unnecessary CSS tags
  
fixed missing nav bar ID tag

gave larger sections of the page an ID rather than Class

In the HTML I changed CSS tags on DIVs within a common element to a shared class, allowing to condense CSS code

Added comments to Html and CSS

Addressed a padding/margin issue with .aside
